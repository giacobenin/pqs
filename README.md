[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/giacobenin/pqs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/giacobenin/pqs)

Code implemented for the 2011 Advanced Data Structures (COP5536) class project at UF.

The project asked to implement Dijkstra's Single Source Shortest Path algorithm for directed graphs using different priotity queues (notably Fibonacci and Binomial Heaps).
